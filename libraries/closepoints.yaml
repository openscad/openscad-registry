  summary: OpenSCAD ClosePoints Library
  description: |
    This is a general purpose OpenSCAD library for easily creating diverse
    shapes by simply creating lists of points which trace out layers in an
    outline of the desired shape. The library consists of modules for creating
    polyhedrons from these lists of points, as well as functions to assist
    in specifying the points using transformations.
