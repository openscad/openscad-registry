  summary: OpenSCAD Function Plotting Library
  description: |
    This is a general purpose function plotting library for OpenSCAD which
    will render functions with Cartesian coordinates (x & y input, z output),
    polar/cylindrical coordinates (r & angle input, z output), or axial
    coordinates (z & angle input, r output). This library is sufficiently
    flexible that it can be used for more than just plotting functions. As
    demonstrated in the included demo files, this can efficiently render
    ordinary objects with surfaces defined by mathematical functions.
