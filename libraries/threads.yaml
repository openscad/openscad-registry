  summary: OpenSCAD threads.scad module
  description: |
    This is an efficient OpenSCAD threading library intended primarily to
    be used as a component in other designs. It supports metric compatible
    internal and external threads, auger threads, thread tapering, clearance
    holes, countersunk holes, recessed holes, hex bolts, nuts, washers,
    Phillips tips, and long rods which are extended with threaded joints.
    Whenever possible this complies with metric standards for the defaults
    of parameters, while providing overrides for many values.
